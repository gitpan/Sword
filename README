INSTALLATION

You must already have a copy of the Sword library installed on your system with
the development libraries. In the future, I may provide an Alien::Sword library
to help with this.

On a Debian or Ubuntu system, this means:

  sudo aptitude install build-essential libsword-dev

The usual Perl installation should do the trick.

I recommand installing App::cpanminus and running:

  cpanm Sword

OR the regular CPAN should work:

  cpanm Sword 

OR manually, by downloading, unpacking the tarball, and running this from the
unpacked directory:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The installation has (so far) only been tested on Linux by myself. Mac OS X
should be similar. If you want to use this on Windows, please give it a shot and
let me know what goes wrong. I have a Windows machine I can try it on if someone
wants it.

I will try to watch CPANTS to see if I can get other platforms working.

See the POD in Sword.pm for usage:

  perldoc Sword
